**# 📘 OOP Student–Mentor System

This project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python using real-world examples such as **students**, **mentors**, and their relationships.

It is designed as a **learning project** to help understand:
- Classes and objects
- Instance methods vs class methods
- Object relationships (One-to-Many, Many-to-Many)
- Clean OOP design principles
